A web app to keep track of places I’ve been and places I want to go

<!--more-->

Places is a web app I’m building to keep track of places I’ve been and places I want to go. You can search for places (restaurants, breweries, museums, venues, or anything else that interests you), save them, and add notes — like why you are saving it or a recommendation from a friend who’s been there. I’m posting updates and things I learn as I go. This page collects those updates.

If you are interested in trying Places, [sign up for the waitlist](https://tryplaces.com/waitlist) and be among the first to know when it’s ready.
