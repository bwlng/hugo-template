Stephen Bowling - Web team lead. User experience designer.

<!--more-->

I lead the web team for a global manufacturing company. I founded [Studiosaurus](https://studiosaurus.com/), a web design, development, and strategy consultancy in Baton Rouge, Louisiana where I worked with direct clients and advised leadership and led product development for agencies without dedicated digital teams.

Previously, I worked as VP Interactive at Rockit Science Agency, a boutique ad agency, where I set the digital vision and led the web team and projects for clients including NEEA, LUBA Workers’ Comp, and LSU.

A musician at heart, I’ve toured and recorded music with many bands you’ve never heard of including Leda Swan and We Landed on the Moon!. In 2013 I co-founded Handsome Machines with Daniel Patterson and Peter Browne. Our debut record ELIZA was released in 2015.

I live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana with my wife, Erin, our son, and two dogs.
